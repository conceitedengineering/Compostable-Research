# Definition
A Biobased polymer derived from the biomass or issued from monomers derived
from the biomass and which, at some stage in its processing into finished
products, can be shaped by flow. According to [International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry)

Wikipidea Notes:
Note 1: Bioplastic is generally used as the opposite of polymer derived from
fossil resources.

Note 2: Bioplastic is misleading because it suggests that any polymer derived
from the biomass is environmentally friendly.
