# Compostable-Research
Reaserach for Precious Plastics class Spring19

# Definition
A Biobased polymer derived from the biomass or issued from monomers derived
from the biomass and which, at some stage in its processing into finished
products, can be shaped by flow. According to [International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry)

Wikipidea Notes:
Note 1: Bioplastic is generally used as the opposite of polymer derived from
fossil resources.

Note 2: Bioplastic is misleading because it suggests that any polymer derived
from the biomass is environmentally friendly.

### In the US the FTC sets the law 
Terms like 'Compostable' and 'Carbon Offsetting' are [regulated](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f00c83a09e04a53eb071e891966724a4&mc=true&node=se16.1.260_17&rgn=div8).

[Guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/plain-language/Environmental%20Claims%20Summary%20of%20the%20Green%20Guides.pdf) businesses are expected to follow.

# History

* 1862 – Alexander Parkes creates the first man-made polymer from an organic material derived from cellulose. It was a bio-based plastic and was called [Parkesine](http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Parkesine).
* 1926 – French scientist Maurice Lemoigne developed polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from bacterium Bacillus megaterium. The first bioplastics made from bacteria.
* 1930s – [Henry Ford!](https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-resources/popular-topics/soy-bean-car/) used bioplastics made from soy beans for some car parts. Ford stopped using soy plastics after WWII because of the abundance of cheap oil supply.
* 1907 – Leo Baekeland invents [Bakelite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakelite) and it will be described as a National Historic Chemical Landmark due to its importance. Bakelite was a synthetic plastic that was revolutionary for its electrical nonconductivity and heat-resistant properties in electrical insulators, radio and telephone casings and such diverse products as kitchenware, jewelry, pipe stems, children’s toys, and firearms.
* 1990 – Imperial Chemical Industries (UK) developed a bioplastic that was biodegradable. It was called named Biopol.
* 1990 – Commercial demand for bioplastics starts to develop, driven by oil price volatility and environmental concerns.
